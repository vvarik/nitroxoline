# Introduction

Analysis for nitroxoline chemical genetics [*Cacace et al
2025*](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.04.597298v1).

# Look at raw data

The effect of the conditions (compared to LB) was small.

# Data analysis

Working in parallel with both opacity (which we prefer) and colony size:

1.  Bring the median of two outermost columns/rows multiplicatively to
    plate median
2.  Calculate the mutant fitness as a fraction of the plate median
3.  Estimate the multiplicative change in mutant fitness per condition
    using empirical Bayes’ moderated T-test

# Step 1 | Adjust outer rows/cols

As the adjustment was multiplicative, larger deviations from plate
median appear corrected “more strongly” in linear scale, i.e. were
y-axis in log scale, dark and light grey points would be parallel.

# Step 2 | Calculate fitness

There’s some interesting subset with lower opacity and bigger size than
on average.

# Step 3 | Change per condition

In the following, names are given to genes of mutants with more than
2-fold and significantly changed fitness.

One could speculate that the stronger effect of a drug, as for nitro2 vs
nitro1 was beneficial to elucidate the phenotype.
